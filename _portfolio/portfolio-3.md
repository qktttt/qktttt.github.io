## Introduction
Corn planting and harvesting schedules are essential for managing storage capacity and reducing waste. If planting schedules are not carefully planned, weekly harvest quantities can exceed storage limits, leading to wastage, or fall short, resulting in inefficiencies. The goal of this project is to develop a practical approach for scheduling corn planting that minimizes waste, ensures consistent harvests, and respects storage capacity constraints.

This project builds on the 2021 Syngenta Crop Challenge, which asked participants to design better planting schedules for corn populations. The challenge involved predicting harvest times based on weather data and optimizing planting schedules to address storage limitations. 

## Background
Corn populations need a specific amount of warmth, measured as Growing Degree Units (GDUs), to reach maturity. Daily GDUs depend on temperature, and predicting these values is critical for estimating harvest times. Additionally, planting schedules must align with fixed storage capacities at harvest sites to avoid overproduction and wastage.

To solve this problem, optimization methods can balance different objectives, such as reducing weekly harvest variability and minimizing waste. Genetic algorithms are particularly suitable for this kind of problem, as they can search for good solutions in a complex and constrained setting.

## Methodology
1. **Predicting GDUs**:  
   - Historical weather data from 2009 to 2019 was used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for daily GDU predictions. 
   - The LSTM model was implemented using Python's Keras library, which provided a flexible and efficient platform for handling time-series data. These predictions allowed us to estimate when each corn population would be ready for harvest.

2. **Optimizing Planting Schedules**:  
   - A genetic algorithm was used to optimize planting dates for over 2,500 corn populations, implemented with the R `nsga2` package. This multi-objective algorithm was used to balance the following goals:
     - Minimize the median and maximum difference between weekly harvest quantities and storage capacity.
     - Reduce the number of weeks with non-zero harvests.
     - Minimize the amount of corn wasted due to exceeding storage limits.
     - [Placeholder for Genetic Algorithm Figure: Visualization of the optimization process or Pareto front generated by the genetic algorithm.]

   - The algorithm's flexibility allowed us to explore a wide solution space and identify effective planting schedules.

3. **Selecting the Best Solution**:  
   - Solutions were evaluated using Pareto optimality, identifying trade-offs between the objectives. 
   - The hypervolume indicator and TOPSIS method were used to select the best solution from the Pareto front, ensuring an optimal balance among the objectives.

## Results
The framework was tested on real-world data provided by the Syngenta Crop Challenge. It successfully produced planting schedules that reduced waste, minimized weekly harvest variability, and improved storage efficiency compared to the baseline solutions. The LSTM model implemented in Python accurately predicted GDUs, and the genetic algorithm in R was effective at finding optimized schedules.

## Conclusion
This project provides a straightforward and practical method for optimizing corn planting schedules. By combining predictive modeling using Python and optimization techniques implemented in R, it addresses key challenges like inconsistent harvests and storage constraints. The approach can also be applied to similar agricultural scheduling problems, making it a useful tool for improving resource management and reducing waste.
