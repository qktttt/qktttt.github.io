The Datanugget R package [2] is designed to summarize large datasets while preserving their structural and statistical properties. It achieves this by partitioning the data into smaller, weighted units called "data nuggets," each representing a cluster of observations with similar characteristics. These nuggets are characterized by a center, weight, and scale, which collectively capture the data's variability and distribution. By reducing the computational complexity, the datanugget package enables efficient application of statistical methods such as clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), and even the supervised learing methods, on datasets that are too large to handle directly. This makes it particularly useful for big data analysis, where preserving the integrity of data structures, including small clusters and edge information, is critical for meaningful insights.

*In the nugget creation phase, as shown in the above figure,the goal is to reduce a large dataset into smaller, representative units called nuggets. Each nugget summarizes a subset of the data using three key properties:*

1. *Center: Represents the central point of the subset (e.g., mean or centroid).*
2. *Weight: Reflects the number of original observations in the nugget.*
3. *Scale: Captures the variability or spread of the data within the nugget.*

*In the nugget refinement phase, the initial nuggets are analyzed to ensure they accurately represent the datasetâ€™s structure. Nuggets that are too large, have high variability, or are elongated are split into smaller nuggets for better granularity.*


The Datanugget R package, while effective in reducing large datasets and preserving their structural properties, faces significant limitations in speed and capacity when handling extremely large datasets, such as those with millions of observations. On consumer-grade computers, the execution can become prohibitively slow, often failing to complete due to memory constraints. These limitations stem from the computational overhead required to partition and process large datasets into data nuggets, which increases significantly with dataset size.

In this project, the original Datanugget package is rewritten in Python, focusing on optimizing its speed and capacity. The new Python-based package has been designed to handle large-scale datasets with millions of observations efficiently, overcoming the performance and memory limitations of the original R implementation. By leveraging Python's robust libraries for numerical computing and parallel processing, the package achieves significantly faster execution while maintaining the structural integrity and statistical properties of the data. This enhanced version enables the practical application of data nugget techniques on consumer-grade computers for large-scale datasets, making it a more scalable and accessible tool for big data analysis.

Our initial experiments shows that, compared to the original R package, our Python version Datanugget package:
1. Has an average speedup of %562.2 over the original R package. 
2. One a desktop computer with 32 Gigabytes, the Python version package can process data of 50 millions observations with 10 variables

More details and ready-to-use code will be available soon.
